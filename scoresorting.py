# Score of a String
# You are given a string s. The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.

# Return the score of s.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "code"

# Output: 24
# Explanation: The ASCII values of the characters in the given string are: 'c' = 99, 'o' = 111, 'd' = 100, and 'e' = 101. The score of s will be: |111 - 99| + |100 - 111| + |101 - 100|.

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "neetcode"

# Output: 65
# Constraints:

# 2 <= s.length <= 100
# s is made up of lowercase English letters.
